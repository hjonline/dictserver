# dictserver

Dictionary library and API server based on data from the *Project Gutenberg EBook of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary*. The API responses (as shown below) will remain backwards/forwards-compatible. If compatibility is broken, it will be under a `/v2/` URL and be released as v2.x.x.

See the dictionary folder for usage as a Go library and the parsing code. The library can be used to create dictionaries from other sources. The on-disk format and library interface will remain backwards-compatible on a best-effort basis. If backwards-compatiblility is broken, it will break with an error message (rather than silently and cause other issues).

            "Precedent; case; instance.   Example, Instance. The discrimination to be made between these two words relates to cases in which we give \"instances\" or \"examples\" of things done. An instance denotes the single case then \"standing\" before us; if there be others like it, the word does not express this fact. On the contrary, an example is one of an entire class of like things, and should be a true representative or sample of that class. Hence, an example proves a rule or regular course of things; an instance simply points out what may be true only in the case presented. A man's life may be filled up with examples of the self- command and kindness which marked his character, and may present only a solitary instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word \"example\" should never be used to describe what stands singly and alone. We do, however, sometimes apply the word instance to what is really an example, because we are not thinking of the latter under this aspect, but solely as a case which \"stands before us.\" See Precedent."

When no entries are found for a word, a 404 error (for backwards compatibility)
will be returned along with the following body:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "result": []
}
```

Note that for an internal server error, a 500 response code will be returned
along with a response body like:

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "result": "the error message..."
}
```
